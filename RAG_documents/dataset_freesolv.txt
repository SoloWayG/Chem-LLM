The FreeSolv database offers a curated collection of experimental and calculated hydration-free energies for small molecules in water. It includes both experimental values obtained from prior literature and calculated values based on simulations. The goal is to provide accurate hydration-free energy data, which is essential for understanding solvation properties and interactions of molecules in aqueous environments.
