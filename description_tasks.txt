OK, here are the most detailed definitions for classification, regression and generation in machine learning:

Classification:
Classification is a machine learning task in which an algorithm is trained to predict a discrete or categorical value of an output variable
based on input data. The purpose of classification is to determine which of the predefined classes or categories the new data instance belongs to. 
For example, determining whether an email is spam or non-spam, classifying images into categories of objects, identifying handwritten text. 
Classification models usually use algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, neural networks, etc.

Regression:
Regression is a machine learning task in which an algorithm is trained to predict a continuous numeric value of an output variable based on input data. 
The purpose of regression is to quantify the relationship between the input features and the output value. 
For example, forecasting the price of a house based on its characteristics, forecasting sales based on marketing data,
predicting the age of a person based on his image. Regression models typically use algorithms such as linear regression,
polynomial regression, ridge/lasso regression, decision regression trees, etc.

Generation:
Generation is a machine learning task in which an algorithm is trained to create new original data, such as images, 
texts, audio or video, based on training examples. The purpose of generation is to create realistic and meaningful outputs that are similar to the training examples,
but are not exact copies of them. For example, the generation of artistic images, speech synthesis, writing texts in a certain style. 
Models such as variational autoencoders, generative-adversarial networks, transformers, etc. are used to solve generation problems.
